# Jenkins Doc Extendable

This is a fork of [Jenkins Doc by Maarti](https://github.com/Maarti/JenkinsDocExtension)

Original extension: [Jenkins Doc VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Maarti.jenkins-doc)

> **Note:** This was created as part of a company Hackathon. I have not decided yet how to continue this project: create a pull request to the original repo, or do further development and keep it as a separate repo.

## Extra functionality by this fork

It is possible to extend the documentations with your own shared library documentation.
